Add `curl` detection to `Smart Paste` to transform curl commands into Karate syntax. Add option to `Fold` or minimize each `Scenario:` or `Scenario Outline:`.

## 0.4.1

Add option to specify switches when debugging within `feature` property of `launch.json`.

## 0.4.0

## 0.3.3

Remove `classpath:` from command when referencing fully qualified path to test(s).

## 0.3.2

Resolve [task execution issue](https://github.com/kirksl/karate-runner/issues/3) introduced in vscode 1.37 with workaround.

## 0.3.1

Add option to specify entire karate.jar(Standalone) command in settings.

## 0.3.0

Remove reliance on tests having to exist under `src/test/java` especially for karate.jar(Standalone). Downstream this will simplify setting the property `Karate Runner > Tests: To Target` to something like `**/*.feature`. Add `Run All Tests` action for every folder node that is an ancestor of a \*.feature file within Activity Bar Tests view. This will enable running all tests that are scoped below target folders and in scope based on the setting `Karate Runner > Tests: To Target`.

## 0.2.0

Add `Open In Editor` action for _.feature file nodes within Activity Bar Tests view. Add `Collapse All` action to Reports and Tests views within Activity Bar. Add support for Standalone execution mode via karate.jar. Please note the first karate.jar(Standalone), pom.xml(Maven) or build.gradle(Gradle) found **in that order** when traversing backwards from the _.feature file will be used for execution. This will also constitute your project root directory.

## 0.1.3

Hide tests that are commented from Codelens and Activity Bar. Remember last Karate Runner when using `Prompt To Specify` Karate Runner popup.

## 0.1.2

Connect to Github Repo.

## 0.1.1

Resolve project dependencies missing when publishing.

## 0.1.0

Add support for Gradle and Maven. Please note the first pom.xml(Maven) or build.gradle(Gradle) found when traversing backwards from the \*.feature file being tested will be used to run all Maven and Gradle commands. This will also constitute your project root directory. Add support to automatically open any file(s) once tests finish running. For example you may want specific html reports to automatically load into a browser. Add a Karate Activity Bar to VSCode to enable management of reports and tests in a central location.

## 0.0.3

Remove requirement to specify a regular expression to determine where to show a Codelens. A Codelens will now be shown above every `Feature:` and `Scenario:`.

## 0.0.2

Remove requirement for terminal to be set to the pom.xml directory prior to clicking on a Codelens. We now traverse backwards from feature file until a pom.xml is found and call Maven with it.

## 0.0.1

Initial release.
